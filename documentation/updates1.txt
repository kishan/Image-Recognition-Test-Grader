Updates from TP1:

From TP1: 
-finds circles on page (not very accurate- detected a lot of stray and random circles)

ORGANIZE CIRCLES
-organized bubbles into rows by y-coordinate
-organized bubbles in each row by x-coordinate

FILLED BUBBLE FINDER
-Created whitePixelDensity function (creates box around circle, counts number of white pixels, and then divides by area).
-used function to compare density of bubbles in each row
-loop through bubbles in each row to find which bubble has highest density (filled in)
-once finding filled bubble, question number is added to dictionary as key and letter of bubble as value.

IMPROVED ALGORITH
-get rid of stray bubbles which have two or less bubbles in row
-if extra bubbles to left of bubbles ignore them
-reports answer as * if no bubble filled

INTEGRATION
-in TP1 I had the transformation function, scanner function, and circle finding function in all different files seperated
-for TP2 I interlinked all the files so now they all work together (input image file and answers are printed (and added to dictionary)).


DEMO
-works for a couple of hand drawn bubble sheets
-works great for printed out template bubble sheet filled out in any way
